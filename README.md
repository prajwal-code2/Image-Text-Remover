##     <p align = "left"> Introduction üìö </p>

This is a python application that uses the powerful YOLOv8 by ultralytics for object detection and tkinter for graphical user interface. With this application you can detect and count the no. of objects in images/videos and can also track the objects. This application can be modified to be used as a object tracker or people counter entering/exiting the premises.
